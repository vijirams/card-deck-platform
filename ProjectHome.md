Have you ever went camping or went on a field trip, and just when you were about to play your favorite card game with the guys, after going through all your stuff, you realized that you FORGOT your deck AT HOME?!?!
<br />
NO MORE!
<br />

"Card deck platform" is an android application that replaces an actual card deck. This application should allow users to play almost any existing (and non existing) card games. The game is a multi-player game, however, this game is playable only in a face to face manner. Therefore, in order to play this game all the participants should not be far away from each other (just like in an actual card game). The platform is easy to program and thus anyone may add a custom game plugin. The application also has a free play mode. This mode allows one to play a game that was not developed yet. i.e without any programmable logic.

### Uniqueness of our idea ###
Our idea is unique in the way that it simulates an actual card deck.
when one is using our application he doesn't get just one card game but he gets them all. Moreover, the user may use his imagination and invent his own card game.

### Impact ###
Our application can replace the actual card deck and thus we hope that more people would use our application rather than the traditional card deck.
In addition, creating new card games would become more accessible since the only thing that has to be implemented is the game logic (you get all GUI and Communication features for free).
### The need our idea tries to address ###
imagine going with your friends on a picnic/field trip/camping/ or just to the beach, and you forgot to bring you card deck, nowadays more likely that they would all have a smartphone, therefore, using our app you can play any card game that you would like
and feel like you were playing with an actual card deck.
plus, our other main purpose of our application is to be enjoyable as much as possible
and to give the user, as much as possible, the feeling like he was playing with real cards.

### The potential market of our solution ###
Our application is directed to both gamers and game developers. Gamers would be able to play many types of card games while developers would be able to create new card games easily.

### Technological aspects ###
Our application is developed currently for android smartphones and tablets. Our application uses a lot of android devices benefits e.i:
<br />
Bluetooth or wifi in order to communicate.
<br />
Compass in order to determine the relative location of each player.
<br />
Accelerometer in order to detect when a player puts his phone on the table in order to hide hide his cards.

### The difference from similar applications ###
The main differences are in the game experience and flexibility:
<br />
  1. Our application would always show any move that each player does. As seen at the videos when a player makes some move, other players are able to see exactly how he moves his card. In addition the application determines the location of each player so on the game screen each player would sit exactly where he sit (even if he changed position during the game).
  1. The game you want to play doesn't exists and you don't know how to program? No problem! The free play mode actually gives you the ability to play any game you want so you don't have to wait until your favorite card game is implemented.
  1. A developer may easily implement a card game without worrying about GUI or communication. The platform supports game plugins that has just the game logic implementation.
<br />
### Main features ###
  1. Reflecting any move that other players do in your device, representing it in a relative position of where you sit according to others
  1. Peeking reduce: when you tilt your device in an angle in which other players can look at your cards, the application hides your cards automatically
  1. Live position system: placing players on the table according to their relative position from each other, players can move to an empty spot or swap placed between them, one cannot just move to someone else's place without him clearing his spot.<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nvA4OsKBW90' target='_blank'><img src='http://img.youtube.com/vi/nvA4OsKBW90/0.jpg' width='425' height=344 /></a>
  1. Multi-touch functionality: each player can give each card its own angle using one finger to hold the desired card and another to swipe it in the desired direction
  1. Throwing cards: when people don't feel like moving the cards all the way to where they want to put them, they can simple "fling" them and the cards will be thrown to that direction.
  1. Cool animation when cards move, added or removed from an area

The free play mode provides the ability to play a game which was not implemented yet. Unlike "war", in this mode there are no strict rules or game logic, there is only a card deck which you can treat as if it was a real card deck. In the free play mode demo we wanted to show that although Texas Hold'em was not implemented we still managed to play it in the same manner we would have played it with actual card deck.
